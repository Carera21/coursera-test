	<strong>December 15 2016</strong>
<br>
So I finally got myself to write. I have been promising myself that I will do it tomorrow for a whole bunch of days now, maybe weeks. It isn't particularly difficult to sit down and start writting things but I have been postponing it. What I should start doing instead is just making time for it and creating a chain since it is a lot easier to follow a streak than start from scratch. People really love seeing a big chain of actions take, minimalistic if possible, that shows how much they tried. And it feels sooooo wrong when you break it as well. Your whole streak is over, you no longer stick to your plans, you give up. But here is the catchy thing, you can bounce back at it again. One day is ok to miss, but miss two in a row and you started creating a new chain called "Days missed" creating a bad habit instead of working on establishing your new one.
<br>
As of this moment I hope this is something that sticks. It kind of feels good to write your thoughts on a piece of paper. The look of organized deposited ideas, the sense of relief knowing that at whatever moment you can look back at any current day and recall your actions, the satisfaction of reaching a goal once you finish writing them. All of those feelings actually make you feel good, it is the thought of sitting that is in the way. Once you start though, you forget why you didn't do it in the first place. And there you go typing one word after the other, with or without any purposeful theme, just getting them off your head so the next time you can think of something else. Who knows, maybe you get a genius idea, a creative breakthrough, a sense of relief when you sit down once again following the same yet different process.
<br>
Apart from the emotional benefits there are also more to this as well. Day by day you improve your use of the language. Grammar, vocabulary, phrases, syntax, spelling, idioms. Even your humor could get a boost on this. Not to mention future projects will be so much easier since you already created the discipline needed to take action every single day no matter the circumstances. You become reliable because people will know that you deliver all scheduled work in due time. You become persistent feeling incomplete if you didn't reach your goal. And last but not least YOU can plan your future because YOU WILL take actions every single day to be able to look back and say to yourself that yes, you succeeded.
<br>
As this daily deadline is getting to its end I want to make some general suggestions to my future self and get some writing ideas out of my brain. Write about your blog plans, write about a theme you would like to see posted, write about your emotions, write about your friends, write about some experiences, write about your dreams or JUST WRITE. 'Till the next time.
